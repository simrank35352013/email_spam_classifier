# email_spam_classifier

1. Objective

To build a machine learning model that can classify an email as Spam (unwanted) or Ham (legitimate) based on its content.

2. Dataset

Popular dataset: SpamAssassin or UCI SMS Spam Collection

Typical dataset fields:

label → spam / ham

text → email content

Example:

Label	Text
ham	"Hi, are we still meeting tomorrow?"
spam	"Congratulations! You’ve won $1000. Click here now!"
3. Preprocessing

Before training, we clean and prepare the text:

Lowercasing text

Removing stopwords (like the, is, at)

Removing punctuation & numbers

Tokenization (splitting text into words)

Stemming / Lemmatization (reducing words to root form)

Converting text into numeric features:

Bag of Words (BoW)

TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)

Or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT for advanced models).

4. Algorithms Commonly Used

Naive Bayes (fast and effective for text classification)

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest / Decision Trees

Deep Learning (LSTMs, Transformers like BERT for advanced projects)

5. Workflow

Load dataset

Preprocess text

Convert text to vectors (TF-IDF)

Train model (e.g., Naive Bayes)

Evaluate with metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Deploy model (Flask/Django web app or Streamlit).



7. Deployment

Save model using pickle or joblib.

Create a simple web app (Flask / Streamlit) where a user pastes an email, and the app predicts spam or ham.

Host on Heroku, GitHub Pages (with Streamlit Cloud), or AWS.
